## Health

Recently my doctor insisted that I start taking omega-3 fatty acids. A quick [google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=omega+3+acid+benefits) reveals 
so many articles touting the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, I wonder why I didnt start earlier. Any time will tell if this works for me and I will share in this space.

## Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the management of infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology) in a descriptive model, using a version control same versioning as the Dev team uses for source code.

Each public cloud has defined a way to script resource management

[Azure Resource Manager]  
[Aws CloudFormation]  
[Google Cloud Deployment Manager]

Additionally [Hashicorp] [Terraform] is an open-source tool for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure.

Terraform is the tool that aggrigates IaC in front of a public cloud native solution. This interests me as it is the implementation of the adapter pattern that I have been perpetuating for years. Today I decided is time to revisit terraform.
