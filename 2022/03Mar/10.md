## Enter the JS Animations Matrix

Today I discovered the wonderful YouTube Channel [Frank's Labratory]. Which is chock full of beautiful pages written in vanilla JavaScript, Html, CSS, canvas, no libraries code. I [reproduced the Matrix Rain Experiments](../../topics/js/animations/matrix/index.html) in JavaScript and liked it so much that I plan to include it in my chrome extension soon.
