# Introduction

## [Robot Monkey Butler][1]

NTMFS is esentially a blog. As once explained by the architect in the [matrix reloaded][2] this is not the first version of NTMFS

This time It will take on a presentation wiki flavor where each topic can be thought of as a presentable subject.

As I document my discoveries and share them in prose, I expect to create a [learning in public][3] environment. Exciting ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
