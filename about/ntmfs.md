# Introduction

## [Robot Monkey Butler][1]

NTMFS is esentially a blog. As once explained by the architect in the [matrix reloaded][2] this is not the first version of NTMFS.

This time It will take on a presentation wiki flavor where each topic can be thought of as a presentable subject. As I document my discoveries and share them in prose, I expect to create a [learning in public][3] environment. I am very exciting ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) to get started.

### Tools used with NTMFS

- [Marp][t1] - Markdown Presentation Ecosystem
- [Mermaid][t4]- Generation of diagrams and flowcharts from text in a similar manner as markdown.
- [Visual Studio Code][t0] with plugins: [Marp for VS Code][t2], [Mermaid+Draw.io][t3]
