## Pie Day 3.14159

A day of mining monero (XMR) crypto using my raspberry pi. 

### Baking My Pi 

I built this monero miner following another [crypto video][mining] from [Network Chuck][chuck]. Along the way I learned a little bit about how mining works and how slow my old raspberry pi is. There are newer faster models with more memory.

> sudo apt update
>
>sudo apt install git build-essential cmake libuv1-dev libssl-dev libhwloc-dev -y
>
> git clone https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig.git
>
> cd xmrig
>
> mkdir build  && cd build
>
> cmake ..
>
> make

While that was in the oven I went ahead created a new [Monero 
Crypto Wallet][monero]. and grabbed my wallet id.

Now it time to dig in...

> ./xmrig -o gulf.moneroocean.stream:10128 -u 47zzogmbsCtR47S4bXvg9qJRu248Q6yuE14xM52sWS5viwomjQ7dtZHA8GUHAAhk9yhFxmiT3JVfjF3zp8oN13abGopMmxB -p pi1

after a few mins, from the clr, use these commands....  
'h' hashrate, 'p' pause, 'r' resume, 's' results, 'c' connection  

Look at https://moneroocean.stream/

So that is for now...  mining in pi day...
